Overview and origin of Deep6 AI
Name of company : Deep 6 AI

Company incorporation:
 The company was founded by Wout Brusselaers in 2016, he stated that the name of the company was inspired by it’s first client, which was part of the U.S. intelligence community, prior to pivoting into healthcare. The challenge they faced was having abundance of data, which made it hard to retrieve what was truly valuable at any given time. He added “ It felt like an ocean of data with distinct treasures of information scattered in the depths, but hard to find and retrieve. in merchant marine parlance a certain amount of global trade across the oceans would fall victim to the weather or other circumstances. 
Some cargo would fall overboard. And it could be retrieved if it would not sink below six fathoms (old depth metric). Anything sinks deeper than six fathoms was considered irretrievable or “deep sixed”. The company’s mission is to help its client ‘retrieve the irretrievable’ by “mining and interpreting all their unstructured data in real-time, hence the name Deep 6 AI”.

Funding and business activities:
Deep 6 AI announced $17 million in funding at a $50 million valuation of artificial intelligence technology which can find patients for clinical trials in “minutes instead of months”. The company raised 22 million total.
It focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to accelerate and improve the clinical trial recruitment process in the healthcare and life sciences industries. Clinical trial recruitment is a critical aspect of medical research, and Deep 6 AI aims to streamline and enhance this process by using advanced algorithms to identify potential candidates for clinical trials more efficiently.
The company's platform uses natural language processing and other AI techniques to analyze unstructured data from various sources, such as electronic health records, to identify suitable patients for specific clinical trials. By automating and optimizing the patient recruitment process, Deep 6 AI aims to help researchers find eligible participants more quickly, ultimately expediting the development of new treatments and therapies.


Company's customer:
1-	Texas Medical Center: Bill McKeon, CEO of Texas Medical Center said TMC has rolled out the software across its network of 61 health institutions to replace their typical process, which requires employees manually search think  folders of records. McKeon says “In a given case study, it took six months to find 12 eligible patients for a trial, while the same matching process through Deep 6’s software found 80 potential people in minutes”.

2-	Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. 

3-	Cedars-Sinai: A nonprofit academic healthcare organization that focuses on research, education, medical professionals, and the community.
Wout Brusselaers says “ beyond Texas Medical Center the company has signed on roughly 20 customers, including other health centers as well as research organizations and medical device companies”.

Solution company offer:
Almost half of clinical trials fail to meet their enrollment goals because of patient recruitment.  The company itself doesn’t have access to patients’ sensitive information. The way It makes money is through licensing the software as well as creating a marketplace model where pharmaceutical or medical device companies use the platform to connect with medical centers. 
The goal of digitizing medical records, which costs billions of dollars and many years of work, was to establish a big clinical data repository which could be mined and acted upon to improve clinical researches and care delivery. However, a huge amount of ‘little data’, saved and scattered in patient’s record, with no ability to access and analyze it. That’s why is considered “too deep” to mine and analyze. Healthcare organizations find themselves looking for treasure in an ocean of data.   

Technologies used by Deep 6 AI: 
Unlike traditional software which mines only structured date, Deep 6 AI’s software dive deep into the unstructured data of Electronic Medical Records. Most of the information in medical records such as doctor’s notes, genomics data, radiology report is unstructured data and only few companies are capable of reading it.
Natural language processing is used to allows software to understand language then pull together details from the systems, then parse it which allows researchers to filter for conditions. The company also trained the software on making inferences about patients’ condition based on their symptoms.



Competitors: 
Some potential competitors for Deep 6 AI in the broader AI healthcare and clinical trial space could include:

1- TriNetX: TriNetX provides a global health research network that connects healthcare organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations.

2- Tempus: Tempus utilizes AI and machine learning to analyze clinical and molecular data to help doctors make personalized treatment decisions.

3-	nference: nference is a healthcare AI company that focuses on analyzing biomedical data to extract insights for drug discovery and development.

4-	nQ Medical: nQ Medical offers AI solutions for clinical trial optimization, patient recruitment, and site selection.

5-	DeepMind Health: DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's parent company), has been involved in healthcare AI, particularly in areas such as patient data analysis and disease prediction.

6-	IBM Watson Health: IBM Watson Health uses AI to analyze healthcare data for insights into personalized medicine, drug discovery, and clinical trial optimization.
